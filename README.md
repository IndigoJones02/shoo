 Shoo will be an app/website that will be for college kids or new grads that are looking 
 for a cheap and close place to either their job, school, or internship. 
 Users can find roommates and connect with people that are working or going to the school that they are going to. 
 They can even find other cool affordable things to do: shopping, fun activities, and etc. 
 This will make moving and getting assimilated to places easier.
